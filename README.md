# 2D Unity Pacman 

This is a Pacman (single level) game created with 2D Unity for the 2017 Google EDGE camp at APSU.

Included:
- background maze image
- pacman images spliced for animation
- blinky images spliced for animation
- script for the pacdots
- script for blinky's movement
- script for pacman's movement 

Further Potential: 
- one could easily add more ghosts and add on the ghost movement script
- one could add multiple layers resulting in multiple levels
